Drinking the poison
It was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. No, Ill look first, she said, and see whether its marked poison or not. â€”Chapter 1, Down the Rabbit-Hole

As a very fresh university graduate, I have now set off on the treacherous path of looking for employment. Veering between the tween allies of self-doubt and self-assuredness, circling the mountain of idleness and only narrowly missing the slopes of perfectionism and dread.
And on through the path of unknown results I go, wishing for any landmark to point me ahead. How do I know which way to turn? 

If I were to come across a sign of some kind, say, a mysterious magic bottle conveniently placed on a nearby table, labeled drink me, would I drink it?
Maybe, just like Alice I would search for some warning signs, if the bottle says poison or scam, perhaps, I will know this was not the sign I was waiting for, perhaps the bottle would say high salary with lots of benefits, interesting challenges and work-life balance, this bottle, I think, anyone will wish to drink.
But what if, just like Alice, I would find the bottle says nothing but drink me, no warning signs or omens, result unknown. Would I dare? Should I dare? 
How do I know when the right opportunity will present itself, or if it ever will. Should I drink every bottle I come across just in case something interesting will happen? Should I ignore all of them and carry on until I am parched? Maybe no bottle will ever appear for me, how long should I keep looking for one? 

As it turns out I did happen upon a bottle or two, all enticingly beckoning with a lovely drink me label. Some looked or smelled strange enough for me to shrewdly avoid, others were not as easily evaded. The one I drank had some promises on it, I researched and asked and considered carefully, still not knowing if it contains poison or not, but I decided to take the chance anyway.
